# Hypertube

This project was made in cooperation with @kimsappi & @timohive.

React, node.js(express), MongoDB

## Installation

This project is not online for some obvious reasons. But mainly, because the films require quite alot of space.

You can run the application locally by cloning the repo and run `npm run install-all` and `npm run dev` in root. Front will run in port 3000 and back in 5000. Site will start automatically after installation.

## Overlook

The user can download films to the server via torrents and start watching them as soon, as there is a playable buffer. The application searches for subtitles and offers primarily atleast the language that is chosen in the settings.
